<h3>My spleen... I'd wondered where that got to...</h3>

<p>I'm sorry, but the developer seems to have my guts open and lying all over
the table. He tells me this is 'for my own good'. He calls it sweet euphemisms
like 'Maintenance', and 'Upgrading', but really, can you trust
a guy that lives off of espresso and chocolate, holding your life in
his hands?</p>

<p>I really hope that I'm feeling better soon, and that you come back once
he's done tucking all my bits and pieces back where they belong. Who knows,
there might even be some new bits attached when he's done.</p>
