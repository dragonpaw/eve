<h4>Where to get the Key</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/api/">http://myeve.eve-online.com/api/</a> 
and click on the button for the <strong>Full</strong> API key. Enter those two items below,
the User ID, and the API Key.</p>

<p>The full key is needed in order to be able to show you items such as your market
transactions. Without this, we would not be able to generate many of the useful statistics
for this site. If you do not feel comfortable providing it, that's fine. You can still get
a lot of out the widget as an anonymous user.</p>

<p>The API Key permits <strong>read-only</strong> access to your account data. It is not possible
for us to steal your ISK or assets by providing this. There is no way to change anything within
your account without actually logging into EVE Online. We cannot change your skills for you.</p> 

<p><strong>Do not ever use your EVE username and password on this, or any other site. Pick a
different password at least.</strong></p>

<p>Currently we do not use your email address for anything, but some day we may use it to alert
you to POSes running out of fuel, skills being completed, large transactions, or other 
configurable events.</p>
