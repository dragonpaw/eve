	<h3>Developer Error</h3>

<p>I'm sorry, but you've managed to find a bug in the EVE Widget.
This really is most embarrassing. If I wasn't a piece of software, I'd
be blushing and hiding under a rock right about now.</p>

<p>The developer has been notified, as he's obviously been writing code
while intoxicated again, or this never would have happened. I'm sure he
will contact you via email to discuss the problem once he's sobered up
enough to read the detailed error log I just sent him.</p>
