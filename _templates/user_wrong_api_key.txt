When you registered your account with the EVE Magic widget, you provided an
API key for the account numbered {{ account.id }}.

Unfortunately, you provided the 'Limited' key and not the 'Full' one. Since
the EVE Magic Widget does a lot of magic based off of your transaction 
history and inventory, it really won't work without the 'Full' key.

To find the full key, go to http://myeve.eve-online.com/api/ and find the
SECOND button on the page, that says, 'Yes, I need my full access key and
understand what this means.' Once you do this, a second key will appear,
which will give the Widget authorization to view your transaction history.

Please return to the Widget once you have the correct key, and enter it on
the account page at http://eve.magicwidget.net/user/

To prevent further emails, the existing limited key you provided has now
been deleted from the Widget.

If you do not feel comfortable providing this key, then you are free to use
the public functions of the Widget, without logging in. You just will not get
maximum value and 'magic' from the EVE Magic Widget.
