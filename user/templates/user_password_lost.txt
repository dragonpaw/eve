Someone, hopefully you (!), asked for password recovery for your EVE Magic
Widget account.

If this was you, then you're safe, and click on the below link to reset your
password please.

If this was not you, then just delete this email. Until you click on the link
above, your password is unchanged. If you didn't ask for this, then no harm
has occured and no one has logged into your account.
