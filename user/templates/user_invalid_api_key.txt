When you registered your account with the EVE Magic widget, you provided an
API key for the account numbered {{ account.id|e }}.

Unfortunately, the key was refused when the Widget tried to gather your data.
As the key was rejected as being incorrect. Either you changed it recently, or
there was a typo in entering it in the Widget. (Or something is FUBAR in the 
EVE API itself.)

In either case, the invalid key and all account data related to it has been
purged from the Widget. You will need to re-enter the correct API key in
order to reactivate the data collection for that account.

To find the full key, go to http://myeve.eve-online.com/api/ and find the
SECOND button on the page, that says, 'Yes, I need my full access key and
understand what this means.' Once you do this, a second key will appear,
which will give the Widget authorization to view your transaction history.

Please return to the Widget once you have the correct key, and enter it on
the account page at http://eve.magicwidget.net/user/

If you do not feel comfortable providing this key, then you are free to use
the public functions of the Widget, without logging in. You just will not get
maximum value and 'magic' from the EVE Magic Widget.
