Deteis can commonly be found in positions of authority within military or political spheres, something that suits their temperament very well. Their firm belief that the good of the whole must come before the needs of the individual has greatly influenced the shaping of the Caldari State since its foundation.','Male Deteis are generally tall and well groomed, with a fair complexion. An average Deteis male will strike an imposing figure through his height and regal bearing. They are sticklers for rules and regulations and tend to do everything by the book, trying to impose order and stability wherever they go.','Female Deteis tend to be neat and composed, with a wry sense of humor and a no-nonsense outlook on life. In many ways it is thanks to their hard work and tenacity that modern day Caldari society is almost entirely free of gender-based favoritism, judging people by their merits alone.',601,1000006,5,5,6,7,7,1604,3301,3413,1633,'Deteis personify the typical Caldari values of duty, efficiency and loyalty.','Male Deteis are tall and imposing.  They like to do things by the book and see it to everyone\'s benefit to impose order on all situations to the greatest extent possible.','The Deteis female is neat and composed, with a wry sense of humor and a no-nonsense outlook on life.'),(2,'Civire',1,'Civire are the backbone of the Caldari State. Their diligence and unselfish efforts have built it from the grounds up. The Civire are cool, level-headed and relentless in their approach to both trading and fighting. They are more comfortable acting than talking and are never happier than when embroiled in the midst of frenetic activity. They can handle pressure extremely well, an invaluable aid in combat and other stressful situations. Many of the best bounty hunters around are Civire.','Civire males are big-boned and masculine, preferring a clean-shaven chin and closely cropped hair. They have a strong moral core, commonly painting the world in terms of white and black. Never at ease when idle, they tend to identify themselves through their work, with all the emotional repercussions that can entail.','Female Civire are slight in build, lithe and supple. They are ardent and committed workers, never willing to give up. Their discipline and dedication also translates into their domestic life and Civire children are taught the importance of duty and self-control at an early age.',601,1000009,9,6,6,4,5,1603,3301,3319,1631,'Competent and level-headed, the Civire represent the backbone of the Caldari State.','Big-boned and masculine, Civire males are possessed of a powerful work ethic and granite morals.','The Civire female is an ardent and committed worker, disciplined and dedicated in all facets of life.'),(3,'Sebiestor',2,'The Sebiestor are quite energetic. They are innovative thinkers and are always willing to try something new and different. Most of the best Minmatar engineers are from the Sebiestor tribe and through their ingenuity the Minmatar Republic was built from scraps virtually overnight. The Sebiestor are of slight build, but are lithe and often graceful. Pale, taut skin and a thin frame are the norm, and these visual characteristics lead many to believe Sebiestors suffer from constant malnutrition and sickness.','Sebiestor males are contemplative and curious, charming and passionate. They are great tinkerers, but their inquisitive nature makes them ideal for any profession once they\'ve put their mind to it. Their seemingly boundless energy often puts people off, but those that can keep up with them are often swept into great acts and deeds.','Female Sebiestor are kind and considerate but are notorious for their cruel streaks - perhaps a relic of older, harsher times under the Amarrian yoke, when existence couldn\'t be taken for granted. Generally loveable, they are realistic enough to take most things only at face value.',588,1000046,5,6,6,6,7,1607,3302,3392,1634,'Innovative and clever, the Sebiestor are the Matari\'s engineers.','Male Sebiestor are charming and contemplative. They are great tinkerers.','Female Sebiestor are kind and considerate, but notorious for their cruel streaks.'),(4,'Brutor',2,'The Brutor are strong willed and possess a great sense of individuality. The tribal life is very endearing to the Brutor, and they are at the forefront when it comes to unearthing and reviving ancient tribal traditions. They participate in the Republic out of necessity, acknowledging the need for Matari to present a united front. They are a swarthy people, slightly larger and burlier than the other Minmatar tribes. They favor physical prowess over everything else and can be frightening to face in the flesh.','Male Brutor are patient, alert and determined. Their thoughtful, deliberate manner gives them great situational awareness. They rarely like wasting time on idle chat, generally preferring to focus on the task at hand. This is often perceived by others as a gruff manner.','Brutor females are in some ways the opposites of male Brutor. They are dominant, persistent and egocentric. When they set their mind to getting something they usually do; to that end their grace and beauty are great benefits.',588,1000049,9,7,6,4,4,1608,3302,3449,1635,'The Brutor are strong-willed and individualistic, and favor physical prowess above all else.','Male Brutor are patient, alert and determined and possess great situational awareness.','Fierce and strong-willed, the Brutor woman is accustomed to getting what she wants, be it through guile or grit.'),(5,'Amarr',4,'True Amarrians - those directly descended from the Amarrian ethnic group before it conquered its home planet and intermingled with other people - are proud and supercilious, with a great sense of tradition and ancestry. They are considered arrogant and tyrannical by most others. Their presumptions of grandeur suffered a direct hit when they lost a war against the Jovians, thereby losing control of the Minmatar home worlds. This blow, a defining point in their history, is something they are still collectively reeling from.','Amarr males are haughty, cruel and possess an unflagging belief in their own superiority. Although this makes them difficult to deal with, it bestows them with decisiveness and a great sense of purpose. Their ability to focus allows them to forge intricate plans, while their composure gives them the perseverance to see them through.','Amarr females are very class-conscious and formal in their dealings with others. Masters of subterfuge and machination, they forgive little and forget nothing. They have strong family ties and can be very vindictive when someone harms their loved ones. Their rancor can last for generations; inter-family vendettas spanning centuries are not unheard of.',596,1000066,4,10,3,6,7,1601,3303,3413,1628,'True Amarrians are the direct descendants of the original Amarrian ethnic group.  As such, they tend to be proud and supercilious.','Amarr males tend to be haughty and cruel, often possessing an unflagging belief in their own superiority.','Very class-conscious and formal, Amarr females tend towards great protectiveness of their families.'),(6,'Ni-Kunni',4,'The Ni-Kunni were a primitive race conquered some 1000 years ago by the Amarr Empire. Unlike most other races conquered by the Amarrians, the Ni-Kunni adapted far better to Amarr society and today only a small minority is still enslaved. Their home planet of Mishi IV in the Aridia region is an inhospitable place, dry and desolate. The Ni-Kunni thank this hard environment for toughening them up and training them in overcoming adversity. Most Ni-Kunnis are tradesmen and artisans - occupations frequently frowned upon by Amarrians, but still a vital part of the society.','The Ni-Kunni male is sly, cunning and unscrupulous. The only way for a Ni-Kunni to scale the rigid Amarrian social ladder is by amassing great wealth, so most Ni-Kunni males are very conscious of making a healthy profit, though this does not necessarily make them greedy. They know full well the best deals are the ones profiting all parties, and they are never shy in searching out potential trade partners.','Ni-Kunni females very often cultivate an enticing and enchanting demeanor. Before becoming part of the Amarr Empire, the Ni-Kunni had a polygamous society, and although this practice has long been abolished, it lingers on in the relations between Ni-Kunni males and females. Beneath their measured and delicate manner, Ni-Kunni women are just as sly and cunning as their male counterparts.',596,1000072,7,4,8,6,5,1602,3303,3443,1632,'Conquered by the Empire a millennium ago, the Ni-Kunni are now almost seamlessly integrated into Amarrian society, usually filling the roles of tradesmen or artisans.','Money-minded by necessity, the Ni-Kunni male is ever aware of what it takes to amass that which gains him ground in this world.','Enticing and enchanting, Ni-Kunni women are fully aware of the power afforded them by their womanly charms.'),(7,'Gallente',8,'The Gallenteans are originally of French origin, although any direct similarities have long since vanished. Gallenteans value freedom and individual liberty above all else. Being the only true democracy in the universe, the progressive Gallente Federation fosters enterprise and initiative in its citizens. Though they are often hampered by internal strife and petty self-interests, they have many times shown they can be much more flexible and decisive than most others when push comes to shove.','Gallente males are driven and ambitious. They often act self-righteously and are generally very opinionated. They tend to be honest and conscientious, generous in their friendship and ardent adversaries. They can be very courageous when they feel their way of life is under threat.','Gallente females are considerate and kind, their spirit outgoing and lively. They value self-empowerment and can be very creative and resourceful. They are constantly in tune with what counts as a quality lifestyle, and generally tend to be easy-going, cheerful and carefree.',606,1000107,8,4,8,4,6,1605,3301,3436,1629,'As the only true democracy in the universe, Gallenteans value liberty above all else.','Gallente males are driven, ambitious and opinionated.','Gallente females are creative, lively and self-empowered.'),(8,'Intaki',8,'The Intaki were integrated into the Gallente Federation a few centuries ago. Their thoughtful and composed manner suited Gallente society well. Especially good at human interaction, the Intaki are very prominent in the Federal bureaucracy. Though the Gallentean culture has permeated their society, they still cling to a few cultural identities they consider their own, most notably their unusual lifecycle theories.  These theories give them a unique outlook on life and death, and many attribute their stoic nature to this philosophy.','The Intaki male is methodical and reserved, never outspoken or confrontational. He generally best enjoys sitting in quiet reflection; Intaki homes are places of peace and tranquility. The Intaki has good control over his emotions and is able to remain calm under even the most strenuous circumstances.','Intaki females share many of the same traits with their male counterparts: They are quiet and contemplative, moving through the world without making a ripple. Yet their contemplative manner often conjures great beauty through words and visions.  A great deal of the universe\'s most notable artists are female Intakis.',606,1000111,3,6,6,7,8,1606,3301,3426,1630,'The Intaki are thoughtful, composed and proficient communicators.  Their unusual rebirth philosophy gives them a unique outlook on life.','The Intaki male is thoughtful and reserved.','Intaki females tend to be artistic and spiritually inclined.'),(9,'Static',16,'The different branches of Jovians that exist are not the result of variations in geographical or climatic differences, but rather that of genetic engineering through the centuries. The Statics are one of the two main branches. Statics are generally introvert and prefer status quo, both socially and biologically. The Statics regard themselves as observers that should interfere as little as possible with the world. They believe that they are as genetically evolved as can be and generally frown upon large-scale genetic engineering programs.','The male part of the Statics is often aloof and condescending. They are the biggest hoarders of knowledge there is, but they enjoy sitting on their knowledge like dragons on gold, reveling in the knowledge of their own importance. Fortunately, they rarely use their power to influence world events.','The female part of the Statics is more open and friendly to outsiders. Though they are driven by curiosity the same as their male counterparts, they don\'t have the pathological need to sit on it by themselves and are generally quite willing to share in their discoveries. Female Statics pass for what can be termed leaders in the Jovian Empire; other Jovians acknowledge that their stable nature and extensive knowledge makes them best suited for the task.',610,1000177,7,8,5,10,10,1654,3374,3402,NULL,'','',''),(10,'Modifier',16,'The different branches of Jovians that exist are not the result of variations in geographical or climatic differences, but rather that of genetic engineering through the centuries. The Modifiers are the enthusiasts of the Jovian family. They are curious and constantly willing to try or experience something new and fresh. Modifiers have lower life expectancy that other Jovians and are more susceptible to the dreaded Jovian Disease. It seems that by constantly living on the edge makes them burn out faster.','Male Modifiers are constantly in search of something new and different and can never stay in the same place for long. They\'re fickle and undisciplined compared to other Jovians and are prone to manic-depression. They are also the most reckless, which most often takes them into trouble, but sometimes it results in some spectacular new discovery that would otherwise never have been found.','Female Modifiers are renowned within the Jovian Empire for their constant body enhancing experiments. More than any other group, female Modifiers are taking genetic engineering to the extreme and back. There is little rhyme or reasons in their experiments, as they\'re most often done on individual level. Although the results are often disastrous many Jovians put more stock in the chaotic gene therapies of the female Modifiers for finding cure to the Jovian Disease than the more respectable formal research teams.',610,1000178,10,9,7,7,7,1654,3374,3413,NULL,'','',''),(11,'Achura',1,'Achura has been part of the Caldari State for three centuries, joining and leaving the Federation at the same time as the State. Yet the Achur have always remained a mystery to others. Hailing from the inhospitable Saisio system in The Forge, the Achur are as reclusive and introverted as an entity can be while still participating in galactic affairs. Intensely spiritual, the average Achur has little interest in the material world\'s transitory doodads. Achur pilots have been few and far between in the past, but the recent sacrilege of their home world prompted them to take to the skies in greater numbers.','The Achur male is reserved in deeds and manner and is a master of disguising his own thoughts and emotions. Never rash or impulsive, he likes to meditate on every decision of importance. Compassion is not alien to him, but his tendency to look at the bigger picture makes it easier for him to sacrifice short-term gains for long-term benefits.','Female Achur are greatly sought after as teachers and mentors. Their intense interest in the metaphysical world gives them great knowledge of everything from quantum physics to the human psyche. More importantly, these things afford them the patience and modesty to look beyond their own petty interests, allowing them to truly relate to others.',601,1000014,7,6,3,6,8,1603,3301,3402,3022,'Intensely spiritual and deeply introverted, the Achur have taken to the skies en masse after their home world was desecrated by pirates.','Reserved and meditative, the Achur male has a tendency to look at the bigger picture instead of concentrating overmuch on the details.','Female Achur are renowned the universe over for their empathy and understanding, which, coupled with their widespread knowledge, make them ideal as teachers.'),(12,'Jin-Mei',8,'The nation of Jin-Mei is the latest addition to the Federation, having joined only shortly before the Gallenteans came into contact with the Amarr Empire. The Jin-Mei have a very rigorous caste-system, which sometimes clashes with the liberal ideals of the rest of the Federation. The Jin-Mei inhabit the Lirsautton system in Everyshore and, up until now, seldom ventured far from their homes. Due to the civil war raging between the Sang Do overlords, leaders of the Jin-Mei, that is now changing.','The Jin-Mei male is generally carefree and good-humored, though very class-conscious. He is not very curious by nature, rather favoring stability and security. Most put much stock in generating good social appearance.','When the Jin-Mei joined the Federation, the social standing of Jin-Mei women was woefully out of tune with a liberal democracy. Much has changed since then, not least by virtue of Jin-Mei women themselves grabbing the torch of equal opportunity by both hands and carrying it forward with fervor.',606,1000114,6,7,7,5,5,1605,3301,3348,3024,'A recent addition to the Federation, the Jin-Mei are a rigidly caste-controlled society.','Socially aware and class-conscious, the Jin-Mei male generally prefers stability and security over adventure and excitement.','Traditionally downtrodden, Jin-Mei women have in recent times risen to equality with their male counterparts.'),(13,'Khanid',4,'The people of Khanid have endured the political turmoil of their leaders with great dignity and calm. They were originally fellow settlers alongside the Amarrians on Athra, better known today as Amarr Prime. During the height of the Amarr Reclaiming, the Khanid were swept up and merged into the growing Amarr nation. Proving themselves valuable allies to the Amarrians from day one, they have ever since held exalted status within the Empire, with only a handful of them ever actually having to endure slavery. The name Khanid was given to the Khanid chiefs by the Amarrians. It means \"little lord\" or \"lordling\" and is an affectionate term generally given to a cherished friend. The name stuck to the nation as a whole at some point and even after the Khanid domain was granted to one of the great Amarr Holder families, the family adopted the Khanid name as their own, winning the hearts of the Khanid people in the process.','Long before the Amarr Empire took to the sky, Khanid males were recognized as the best ground fighters in the Empire. During the Reclaiming, Khanid warriors were at the forefront in the subjugation of the Ealurians, the Ni-Kunnis and the Matari. Though physical stature and bravery counts for less today than it did then, many Khanid males keep the warrior tradition alive.','The warrior lifestyle of the Khanid males from ancient times has made its mark on the Khanid society. The Khanid female is used to running the household on her own, making her independent and resourceful. Accustomed to making her own decisions, the Khanid female lets no one domineer her and is very much the mistress of her own destiny.',596,1000080,8,8,5,4,5,1654,3303,3300,3023,'Originally integrated into the Empire during the Reclaiming, the Khanids have since gained independence but remain staunchly allied with all things Amarr.','Khanid males have a long, proud tradition of combat superiority, and their lives are often dictated by their culture\'s ancient warrior codes.','Strong and independent through years of being the sole master of her domain, the typical Khanid woman lets no one boss her around.'),(14,'Vherokior',2,'The Vherokior tribe is a splinter tribe from the Starkmanir tribe. The origins of the Vherokiors are actually well known, unlike the other older tribes. Some five thousand years ago a brutal Starkmanir chief was exiled with all his people. The chief led his people into the most inhospitable part of Matar and was never seen again. But several centuries later their ancestors returned to Minmatar society, much changed in appearance and manners. They never revealed the cause for this change, but took to roaming between the other Minmatar tribes in large caravans, living as merchants, healers, scholars and fortune tellers.','Vherkoior males are short but nimble and quick-footed. They possess an easy charm and are quite affable. While the tribal tattoo tradition is something shared by all Matari, Vherokior male shamans have taken it to new heights. The mystical nature of the Voluval ritual, where the soul and karma of the person is revealed through a body tattoo, is exclusively handled by Vherokior shamans and the secrets of the rituals are only known to them.','Vherokior females are renowned for their shrewd business minds. Their bartering skills are second to none and they possess exactly the right mixture of sense and intuition to excel in both commerce and industry. The Vherokiors have long since abandoned their wandering ways, instead opting for small-scale family-run businesses. These small establishments, often small canteens and bistros, are usually operated by the matriarch of the family.',588,1000060,4,3,8,8,7,1654,3302,3380,3021,'The Vherokior are merchants, healers, scholars and fortune tellers.','Vherokior males are short but nimble.
